## Experience

**Machine Learning Intern – PreProdCorp**  
*Jan 2024 – Feb 2024*  
Offered placement after securing 4th place in Buildathon 2024. Worked on agile-based ML pipelines involving Apache Kafka, Linux/WSL, and PySpark for data preprocessing. Built tree-based models and a Deep Q-Network for CartPole using reinforcement learning. Contributed to full-stack workflows with MLFlow, DVC, and Dagshub, and explored NLP using Hugging Face (DistilBERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, T5). Also led sentiment analysis on Amazon Reviews with TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and fine-tuned models.
